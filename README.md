# Q. check if the string is palindrome or not 

✅ Palindrome String Check

This problem checks whether a given string is a palindrome — meaning it reads the same forward and backward.
🔍 Approach

    Iterate from the start of the string to its midpoint.
    At each step, compare the character at position i with the character at position length - i - 1.
    If any mismatch is found, the string is not a palindrome.
